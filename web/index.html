		<h1>Automation Creator</h1>
		<p>Automation Creator is a Slack app that allows users to easily create automations on Slack, similar to workflows. Hack Club, a global non-profit organization for teenage coders, announced that they are removing workflows from their Slack workspace due to the repeated and difficult to govern abuse and spamming of requests. However, they have allowed the members to develop their own solutions and alternatives to workflows. Among many others, I decided to take up this challenge in a way that will be easier for users who don't want to set up and code their own Slack bots.</p>
		<p>However, I have made this tool so that people from any workspace can create automations. As this project expands, with more and more triggers and steps, it will eventually become more useful or widespread than Slack workflows. Just click "Create an Automation" to start, and don't forget to try the AI assistant.</p>
